### **About Bounty Hunt**
THIS MOD IS STILL BEING PORTED TO FABRIC.\
*(This pluging is still in development. If you find any issue please report it!!! Thank you!)*\
This plugin allows you to use a Bounty system on your server using diamonds! You dont need another pluging
installed, this is a standalone plugin. The player can set a bounty on another player and the one who kills
them will receive their payment. No need for a middle man.
