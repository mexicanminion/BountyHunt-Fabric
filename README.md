# **Bounty Hunt - Fabric**

### **About Bounty Hunt**
A server side mod that allows you to add a bounty system to your server using diamonds. No need for a currency mod, keep it vanilla! Players can set a bounty using commands and accessing a GUI to set a bounty. Once a player who has a bounty gets eliminated, the player who eliminated them can claim their bounty!
